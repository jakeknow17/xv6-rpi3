To get started, download the AArch64 bare-metal target toolchain from [this](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) link.

Then, add the corresponding bin folder to your path. For example, if you extracted the toolchain to your home directory, you would add the following directory to your path:

`/home/<user>/arm-gnu-toolchain-<version>-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu/bin`
